# "Licensing"
Tired of being yelled at by walls of upper-case legal text?  Try our "licensing" on for size.

# Philosophy

Copyright laws are a drain on humanity and should be depricated to the extent possible.  As such we choose to release all of our original creative output to Public Domain or Creative Commons, except for our company names and brand/logos.  Attribution is nice, and we appreciate it whenever you make the effort to thank us for our contribution, but you're under no obligation to do so.

# Proposed Usage

Just rename the license to UNLICENSE, update the attribution, drop it into your project folder, and stop worrying about licensing stuff from here on out.

# Gratitude

We wish to thank Arto Bendiken for sharing his Unlicense concept with the world (http://ar.to/)
